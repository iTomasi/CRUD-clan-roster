This is a Clan Roster CRUD on the server side it was developed in NodeJS which these modules were used:

<ul>
<li>Express</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Multer</li>
<li>Dotenv</li>
<li>Cors</li>
</ul>

on the client side it was developed with vanilla JavaScript (native code)

<h1>How to use</h1>

In the route "server/src/database/mysql.js" you need to put your database with his all datas then you need to go in the same folder open "database.sql" file and copy all the code and paste in your MySQL Database.

after you need to run "client/index.html" on XAMPP or if you use Visual Studio Code IDE open that file with Live Server plugin and with all this will be work without problem.
